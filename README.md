[Team 24] Mathematical Modelling of Circadian Rhythms and Drug Interactions

The contents and description of each file in the repository.
- [circadian_simulation.ipynb](https://github.gatech.edu/agarg78/circadian_model_cse6730/blob/main/circadian_simulation.ipynb): This is the main notebook for the project and summarizes most of the results and discussions for the project.
- [steady_state_analysis.ipynb](https://github.gatech.edu/agarg78/circadian_model_cse6730/blob/main/steady_state_analysis.ipynb): This notebook provides a steady state analysis for the system of ODEs.
- [\[Team 24\] Mathematical Modelling of Circadian Rhythms and Drug Interactions.pdf](https://github.gatech.edu/agarg78/circadian_model_cse6730/blob/main/%5BTeam%2024%5D%20Mathematical%20Modelling%20of%20Circadian%20Rhythms%20and%20Drug%20Interactions.pdf): Our report for the project.
- [hesse/*](https://github.gatech.edu/agarg78/circadian_model_cse6730/tree/main/hesse): This folder contains the parameters for the model proposed by Hesse et al.
- [modified_circadian_simulation.ipynb](https://github.gatech.edu/agarg78/circadian_model_cse6730/blob/main/modified_circadian_simulation.ipynb): This notebook does steady state analysis for the model proposed by Hesse.
- [processed_*.csv]: Processed data used to train the model.
- [parameter_corrections.txt]: Yeah, we forgot to remove the file. This file has the parameters for the Hesse model but without any formatting and largely a dump.
